# Programming Challenge (Optional)

# Calculate the detour distance between two different rides. Given four latitude / longitude pairs, 
# where driver one is traveling from point A to point B and driver two is traveling from point C 
# to point D, write a function (in your language of choice) to calculate the shorter of the detour 
# distances the drivers would need to take to pick-up and drop-off the other driver.

coordinates =[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]]
